# simple-ga
this is a javascript library for basic calculations of geometric algebras, including conformal geometric algebra.

* functional style with simple data structures
* unlimited dimensions
* no metaprogramming

the code can also serve as an instructional example for implementing geometric algebra calculations in code.

# usage
compiled/simple-ga.js contains the javascript version.
include the code in the browser using <script > tags or in node.js using require "./simple-ga.js".

# examples
examples using the [coffeescript](https://coffeescript.org/) javascript syntax.

~~~
r3 = new simple_ga [1, 1, 1]
e1 = r3.basis 1
e2 = r3.basis 2
e3 = r3.basis 3
e12 = r3.gp e1, e2
exterior_product_result = r3.ep e1, e2
~~~

~~~
mv_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]  # 3e1 + 4e2
mv_b = [[3, 6], [5, -2]]  # 5e1e2 - 2e2e3
inner_product_result = r3.ip mv_a, mv_b
~~~

~~~
[ps_ids, _] = r3.pseudoscalar()
ps_grade = r3.grade ps_ids[0]  # should be 3
ps_squared = r3.gp ps, ps  # should be -1 for this space

# data structures
blades are identified by bit-set integers, since this naturally encodes the subset nature of basis vectors. this allows quick access to operations like blade addition, where bitwise or operations can combine different basis vectors or blades. blade identifier 0 is for the scalar.

multivectors are 2-arrays of arrays [blade_identifiers, coefficients]. this is a sparse representation and can be modified to use different number array types like Float64Array.
multivector blade coefficients are therefore accessed via "mv[1][index]".
the compromise of this data structure is that the indices of blade identifiers have to be first found inside the blade_identifier list mv[0] to know the corresponding coefficient index.

# conformal geometric algebra
core geometric algebra operations remain the same in conformal geometric algebra, no special library setup is necessary.

in conformal geometric algebra, the interpretation of core operations and the structure of the space in which they are applied are significantly different due to the conformal models particular choice of metric and dimensional embedding. null vectors square to zero, unlike typical euclidean vectors.
